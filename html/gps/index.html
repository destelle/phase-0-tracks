	this is my reflection of my gps. the purpose of the semantic tags is to make the code cleaner and more organized. I see the header/ footer as the most useful. the broswer uses the semantic tags to determine the elements. I learned that i can use tab to auto fill in data as well as make my own with snippet. I will probably make other snippets but as of now im not sure what. I think the hardest part was knowing the acutal mean/ what each tag was doing. i had a general idea/ concpet that were close but not nessaceraly the answer
